Description: Fast, lightweight toolkit for data splitting. Data sets can
    be partitioned into disjoint groups (e.g. into training, validation,
    and test) or into (repeated) k-folds for subsequent cross-validation.
    Besides basic splits, the package supports stratified, grouped as well
    as blocked splitting. Furthermore, cross-validation folds for time
    series data can be created. See e.g. Hastie et al. (2001)
    <doi:10.1007/978-0-387-84858-7> for the basic background on data
    partitioning and cross-validation.
