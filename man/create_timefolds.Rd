\title{Creates Folds for Time Series Data}
\usage{
create_timefolds(y, k = 5L, use_names = TRUE, type = c("extending", "moving"))
}
\arguments{
\item{y}{Any vector of the same length as the data intended to split.}

\item{k}{Number of folds.}

\item{use_names}{Should folds be named? Default is \code{TRUE}.}

\item{type}{Should in-sample data be "extending" over the folds (default)
or consist of one single fold ("moving")?}
}
\value{
A nested list with in-sample ("insample") and out-of-sample ("outsample")
indices per fold.
}
\description{
This function provides a list with in- and out-of-sample indices per fold used for
time series k-fold cross-validation, see Details.
}
\details{
The data is first partitioned into k+1 sequential blocks B_1 to B_{k+1}.
Each fold consists of two index vectors: one with in-sample row numbers,
the other with out-of-sample row numbers. The first fold uses B_1 as in-sample
and B_2 as out-of-sample data. The second one uses either B_2
(if \code{type = "moving"}) or {B_1, B_2} (if \code{type = "extending"})
as in-sample, and B_3 as out-of-sample data etc. Finally, the kth fold uses
{B_1, ..., B_k} ("extending") or B_k ("moving") as in-sample data, and B_{k+1}
as out-of-sample data. This makes sure that out-of-sample data always
follows in-sample data.
