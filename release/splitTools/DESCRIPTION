Description: Fast, lightweight toolkit for data splitting. Data
    sets can be partitioned into disjoint groups (e.g. into training,
    validation, and test) or into (repeated) k-folds for subsequent
    cross-validation. Besides basic splits, the package supports
    stratified as well as grouped splitting. See e.g. Hastie et al. (2001)
    <doi.org/10.1007/978-0-387-84858-7> for the basic background on data
    partitioning and cross-validation.
