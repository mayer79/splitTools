## Introduction

`splitTools` is a fast, lightweight toolkit for data splitting. 

Its two main functions `partition` and `create_folds` support

- data partitioning (e.g. into training, validation and test),

- creating folds for cross-validation,

- creating *repeated* folds for cross-validation,

- stratified splitting (e.g. for stratified cross-validation), 

- grouped splitting (e.g. for group-k-fold cross-validation) as well as

- blocked splitting (if the sequential order of the data should be retained).

The function `create_timefolds` does time-series splitting where the out-of-sample data follows the (growing) in-sample data.

We will now illustrate how to use `splitTools` in a typical modelling workflow.

## Data partitioning

We will go through the following three steps:

1. Split the data set `iris` into 60% training data, 20% validation and 20% test, stratified by the variable `Sepal.Length`. Since it is numeric, stratification is done internally by quantile binning.

2. We then tune the parameter `mtry` of a random forest to predict `Sepal.Length` as good as possible by the other variables. We do this on the validation data.

3. After selecting the best `mtry`, we challenge the final model on the remaining test data set.

```{r}
library(splitTools)
library(ranger)

# Split data into partitions
set.seed(3451)
inds <- partition(iris$Sepal.Length, p = c(train = 0.6, valid = 0.2, test = 0.2))
str(inds)

train <- iris[inds$train, ]
valid <- iris[inds$valid, ]
test <- iris[inds$test, ]

# Root-mean-squared error function used to evaluate results
rmse <- function(y, pred) {
  sqrt(mean((y - pred)^2))
}

# Tune mtry on validation data
valid_mtry <- numeric(ncol(train) - 1)

for (i in seq_along(valid_mtry)) {
  fit <- ranger(Sepal.Length ~ ., data = train, mtry = i)
  valid_mtry[i] <- rmse(valid$Sepal.Length, predict(fit, valid)$predictions)
}

valid_mtry
(best_mtry <- which.min(valid_mtry))

# Fit and test final model
final_fit <- ranger(Sepal.Length ~ ., data = train, mtry = best_mtry)
rmse(test$Sepal.Length, predict(final_fit, test)$predictions)
```

## Cross-validation

Since our data set consists of only 150 rows, investing 20% of observations for validation is neither very robust nor data efficient. Let's modify the modelling strategy by replacing simple validation by five-fold cross-validation, again using stratification on the response variable.

1. Split the data set `iris` into 80% training data and 20% test, stratified by the variable `Sepal.Length`. 

2. Use stratified five-fold cross-validation to tune the parameter `mtry`. We do this on the training data.

3. After selecting the best `mtry` by this simple "GridSearchCV", we challenge the final model on the test data set.

```{r}
# Split into training and test
inds <- partition(iris$Sepal.Length, p = c(train = 0.8, test = 0.2))

train <- iris[inds$train, ]
test <- iris[inds$test, ]

# Get stratified cross-validation in-sample indices
folds <- create_folds(train$Sepal.Length, k = 5)

# Tune mtry by GridSearchCV
valid_mtry <- numeric(ncol(train) - 1)

for (i in seq_along(valid_mtry)) {
  cv_mtry <- numeric()
  for (fold in folds) {
    fit <- ranger(Sepal.Length ~ ., data = train[fold, ], mtry = i)
    cv_mtry <- c(cv_mtry, 
                 rmse(train[-fold, "Sepal.Length"], predict(fit, train[-fold, ])$predictions))
  }
  valid_mtry[i] <- mean(cv_mtry)
}

# Result of cross-validation
valid_mtry
(best_mtry <- which.min(valid_mtry))

# Use optimal mtry to make model
final_fit <- ranger(Sepal.Length ~ ., data = train, mtry = best_mtry)
rmse(test$Sepal.Length, predict(final_fit, test)$predictions)
```

## Repeated cross-validation

If feasible, repeated cross-validation is recommended in order to reduce uncertainty in decisions. The process is the same as above. Instead of getting five performance values per fold, we get five times the number of repetitions (here, three).

```{r}
# We start by making repeated, stratified cross-validation folds
folds <- create_folds(train$Sepal.Length, k = 5, m_rep = 3)
length(folds)

for (i in seq_along(valid_mtry)) {
  cv_mtry <- numeric()
  for (fold in folds) {
    fit <- ranger(Sepal.Length ~ ., data = train[fold, ], mtry = i)
    cv_mtry <- c(cv_mtry, 
                 rmse(train[-fold, "Sepal.Length"], predict(fit, train[-fold, ])$predictions))
  }
  valid_mtry[i] <- mean(cv_mtry)
}

# Result of cross-validation
valid_mtry
(best_mtry <- which.min(valid_mtry))

# Use optimal mtry to make model
final_fit <- ranger(Sepal.Length ~ ., data = train, mtry = best_mtry)
rmse(test$Sepal.Length, predict(final_fit, test)$predictions)
```

## Time-series cross-validation and block partitioning

When modelling time series, usual cross-validation destroys the sequential nature of the data. This can be avoided by the following modification of k-fold cross-validation:

The data is first split into $k+1$ blocks $B_1, ..., B_{k+1}$, in sequential order. Depending of `type = "extending"` (default) or `type == "moving"`, the following data sets are used in cross-validation:

- First fold: $B_1$ is used for training, $B_2$ for evaluation.

- Second fold: $\{B_1, B_2\}$ resp. $B_2$ is used for training if type is "extending" resp. "moving", $B_3$ for evaluation.

- ...

- $k$-th fold: $\{B_1, ..., B_k\}$ resp. $B_{k}$ is used for training for type "extending" resp. "moving", $B_{k+1}$ for evaluation.

These schemata make sure that the evaluation data set always follows the training data. Note that the training data grows over the whole process linearly with `type = "extending"` whereas its length is approximately constant with `type = "moving"`.

In order to have a final evaluation of the optimized model, typically an initial blocked split into sequential training and testing data is done.

### Example

We first create a time series and derive lagged features for training. Then, again, we optimize `mtry` of a random forest by time-series cross-validation. We evaluate the optimized model on the last 10% of the time series.

```{r}
# Create data
set.seed(452)
n <- 1000
t <- seq(0, 2 * pi, length.out = n)
y <- 0.2 * sin(t) - 0.1 * cos(t) + 0.2 * runif(n)
plot(y ~ t, pch = ".", cex = 2)

# Helper function
Lag <- function(z, k = 1) {
  c(z[-seq_len(k)], rep(NA, k))
}
Lag(1:4, k = 1)

# Add lagged features
dat <- data.frame(y, 
                  lag1 = Lag(y), 
                  lag2 = Lag(y, k = 2), 
                  lag3 = Lag(y, k = 3))
dat <- dat[complete.cases(dat), ]
head(dat)
cor(dat)

# Block partitioning
inds <- partition(dat$y, p = c(train = 0.9, test = 0.1), type = "blocked")
str(inds)

train <- dat[inds$train, ]
test <- dat[inds$test, ]

# Get time series folds
folds <- create_timefolds(train$y, k = 5)
str(folds)

# Tune mtry by GridSearchCV
valid_mtry <- numeric(ncol(train) - 1)

for (i in seq_along(valid_mtry)) {
  cv_mtry <- numeric()
  for (fold in folds) {
    fit <- ranger(y ~ ., data = train[fold$insample, ], mtry = i)
    cv_mtry <- c(cv_mtry, 
                 rmse(train[fold$outsample, "y"], 
                      predict(fit, train[fold$outsample, ])$predictions))
  }
  valid_mtry[i] <- mean(cv_mtry)
}

# Result of cross-validation
valid_mtry
(best_mtry <- which.min(valid_mtry))

# Use optimal mtry to make model and evaluate on future test data
final_fit <- ranger(y ~ ., data = train, mtry = best_mtry)
test_pred <- predict(final_fit, test)$predictions
rmse(test$y, test_pred)

# Plot
x <- seq_along(dat$y)
plot(x, dat$y, pch = ".", cex = 2)
points(tail(x, length(test$y)), test$y, col = "red", pch = ".", cex = 2)
lines(tail(x, length(test$y)), test_pred)

```

## Stratification on multiple columns

The helper function `multi_strata()` takes a data frame with multiple columns and turns it into a factor. Each level represents a stratification group containing (quite) similar rows. The factor can then be passed to `create_folds(, type = "stratified")` or `partition(, type = "stratified")` to produce (quite) balanced folds regarding these strata. 

Two grouping strategies are offered:

1. k-means clustering based on scaled input.
2. All combinations of columns, where numeric input is being binned.

Let's have a look at a simple example where we want to model "Sepal.Width" as a function of the other variables in the iris data set. We want to do a stratified train/valid/test split, aiming at being balanced regarding not only the response "Sepal.Width", but also regarding the important predictor "Species". In this case, we could use the following workflow:

```{r}
set.seed(3451)

ir <- iris[c("Sepal.Length", "Species")]
y <- multi_strata(ir, k = 5)
inds <- partition(
  y, p = c(train = 0.6, valid = 0.2, test = 0.2), split_into_list = FALSE
)

# Check
by(ir, inds, summary)
```
